# Overview

This indexer is created from indexer-sdk, see a more detailed readme in [example indexer repo](https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-indexer-processor-example).

We use the term indexer and processor interchangeably.

# Running the indexer

**Note: all commends below need to be run in the current indexer directory instead of root directory.**

## Steps

Drop the DB if exists. You cannot do this if you are using a cloud provider. Follow the revert migration command below instead.

```sh
psql postgres://username@127.0.0.1:5432/postgres \
    -c 'DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS "example-indexer"'
```

Create the DB.

```sh
psql postgres://username@127.0.0.1:5432/postgres \
    -c 'CREATE DATABASE "example-indexer"'
```

Create a new migration file.

```sh
diesel migration generate create-abc-table \
    --config-file="src/db/postgres/diesel.toml"
```

Run all pending migrations.

```sh
diesel migration run \
    --database-url="postgresql://username:@localhost:5432/example-indexer" \
    --config-file="src/db/postgres/diesel.toml"
```

In case you want to revert all migrations. On cloud provider, you cannot drop database, so you need to revert all migrations if you want to reset.

```sh
diesel migration revert \
    --database-url="postgresql://username:@localhost:5432/example-indexer" \
	--config-file="src/db/postgres/diesel.toml" \
	--all
```

Create a `config.yaml` file from `example.config.yaml` file to point to the correct network, db url, start version, etc. Run the indexer.

```sh
cargo run --release -- -c config.yaml
```

You should see the indexer start to index Aptos blockchain events!

# Get ready for cloud deployment

I'm using GCP Cloud Run and Artifact Registry.

You can learn more about publishing to Artifact Registry on their docs:

- https://cloud.google.com/artifact-registry/docs/docker/pushing-and-pulling#pushing
- https://cloud.google.com/artifact-registry/docs/docker/store-docker-container-images

And deploying to Cloud Run:

- https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/quickstarts/deploy-container

## Build the docker image locally and run the container locally

Build the docker image targeting linux/amd64 because eventually, we will push the image to Artifact Registry and deploy it to Cloud Run.

```sh
docker build --platform linux/amd64 -t indexer .
```

Run the docker container locally. Mac supports linux/amd64 emulation so you can run the container locally.

```sh
docker run -p 8080:8080 -it indexer
```

## Push the locally build docker image to Artifact Registry

Tag the docker image.

```sh
docker tag indexer us-west2-docker.pkg.dev/indexer-sdk-demo/indexer-sdk-demo/indexer
```

Login to google cloud

```sh
gcloud auth login
```

Push the docker image to the container registry.

```sh
docker push us-west2-docker.pkg.dev/indexer-sdk-demo/indexer-sdk-demo/indexer
```

## Upload the config.yaml file to Secret Manager

Go to secret manager and create a new secret with the content of the config.yaml file.

## Run the container on Cloud Run

Video walkthrough: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JayWuH2qgnqOgzVuZm9MwKT42hj4z0JN/view

Go to cloud run dashboard, create a new service, and select the container image from Artifact Registry, also add a volume to ready the config.yaml file from Secret Manager, then mount the volume to the container.

**NOTE**: always allocate cpu so it always runs instead of only run when there is traffic. Min and max instances should be 1.
